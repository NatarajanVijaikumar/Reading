**Never Split the Difference by Chris Voss**

- “A woman wants her husband to wear black shoes with his suit. But her husband doesn’t want to; he prefers brown shoes. So, what do they do? They compromise; they meet halfway. And, you guessed it, he wears one black and one brown shoe. Is this the best outcome? No! In fact, that’s the worst possible outcome. Either of the two other outcomes—black or brown—would be better than the compromise. Next time you want to compromise, remind yourself of those mismatched shoes.” ‐ Chris Voss

**Insights from Stolen Focus by Johann Hari**

- Focus = fulfillment
    - Without deep focus, we will fail to complete rewarding projects.
    - Without sustained focus on a big goal, we will wander through life. To paraphrase Victor Frankl, “**What man needs is to strive and struggle for a worthwhile goal.**”
    - And without internal focus, we will lack the self‐awareness to know what worthwhile goals to pursue.
- Therefore, fulfillment requires three types of focus: spotlight, starlight, and daylight.
    - A steady **spotlight** lets us focus on a task long enough to make meaningful progress or acquire valuable insights.
    - **Starlight** helps us recall our long‐term goals.
    - **Daylight** helps us evaluate our experiences and determine which long‐term goals to pursue.
- Use the first 60 minutes of the day to restore daylight and starlight and then strengthen your spotlight.
    - Reflect on three questions ‐ What matters most to me? What are my strengths and values? How can I be uniquely valuable to others?
    - Write down long‐term objectives and think of weekly and daily goals that will get you to those objectives.
    - Go deep on one daily goal until the 60‐minute morning focus block ends. Whatever you choose to do, do it slowly and methodically. As Johann Hari says, “**Slowness nurtures attention, and speed shatters it**.”
    
    **Coming Alive By Barry Michels and Phil Stuts**
    
    - Part X lives in each of us and worst critic
    - Tools to negate them:
        - **Black Sun** : Focus on the void where your craving is non existent which ironically self generate self satisfaction
        - **Vortex** : When low on energy imagine 12 suns around you which spins rapidly and you spin along with it which will give you unlimited energy
    - “People who accept that life is made up of pain, uncertainty, and constant work are better equipped and essentially happier than those who are constantly trying to avoid these things”
    
    **Same as Ever by Morgan Housel**
    
    - There are 3 timeless truths:
        - The Punch that killed Houdini (The biggest risk is the risk you won’t see coming)
            - Invest in several uncorrelated assets.
            - Have more cash available in a money market fund.
        - The California super bloom (Too much of a good thing is a catalyst for a really bad thing)
            - It’s always day one.
            - Seek a new opportunity before you exhaust your current opportunity.
        - The world’s largest man (Unrestrained growth = fragility)
    
    **Master of Change by Brad Stulberg**
    
    - 36 number of changes experienced in an adult life. Resisting will cause prolonged suffering. Follow below 3 steps to accept them quickly:
        - Diversify your Identity.
            - "There are times when I lean heavily into each of my main identities—father, husband, writer, coach, friend, athlete, and neighbor... I focus on keeping all of these identities strong, (to) ensure that when things falter in one area of my life, I can rely on the others to energize and pick me up...
            - How can you invest in other areas of your identity to stay buoyant when change threatens one part of your identity?
        - Focus on your core values.
            - Identify what you like the most in space of your life and focus on them.
        - Practice rugged flexibility
            - Continuing with the shipwreck analogy: the first step is finding a raft, the second is sing a compass (aka your core values) to guide you towards land, and the final step requires paddling for a short bit and checking the compass to see if you're still on course. In life, this final step requires experimenting with different strategies while staying aligned with your core values.
            - Practice rugged flexibility – stay stubbornly firm in your values but flexible in your approach while expecting many setbacks.
    - "Change itself is neutral. It becomes negative or positive based on how we view it and, more importantly, what we do with it." – Brad Stulberg
    
    **Ikigai by Hector Garcia and Francesc Miralles**
    
    - How Okinawans ate, moved, and interacted contributed to a longer life. But the key to their longevity was believed to be their ikigai ‐ a strong, guiding sense of purpose.
    - Feel essential.
    - Find flow.
        - Okinawans find this intersection by interacting with members of their moai and making them feel heard and loved (a rare and highly underrated skill).

    - Increase your flow by getting crazy clear on three questions:
        - What's my immediate goal?
        - How am I doing?
        - How might I do slightly better?
    - Concentrating on one thing at a time may be the single most important factor in achieving flow.
    - Your ikigai is at the intersection of what makes you essential to the people who love you and what puts you in a flow state.
    - Once you discover your ikigai, pursuing it and nurturing it every day will bring meaning to your life.
    
    Insights from The Scout Mindset by Julia Galef
    
    - "The map is not the territory" ‐ Alfred Korzybski
    - Soldier mindset - we naturally see arguments as forms of attack and fear our positions might get destroyed. So, we become entrenched in our beliefs, like soldiers holed up in a trench, safe from the enemy’s volleys. And if we do change our minds? That’s surrender."
    - Have Scout mindset - they actively seek out ways they might be wrong. Being wrong is an opportunity to update their map and see the world clearly. When we see the world clearly, we're more compassionate, less anxious, and more likely to make decisions that will benefit our lives and those we care about.
