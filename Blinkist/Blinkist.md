**Surrounded by idiots by Thomas erikson**

The key message in these blinks:

If you want to avoid misunderstandings and make your efforts at communication more effective, then it is in your best interest to understand the four basic personality types. The first personality type is Red, which responds well to being in charge and dealing with challenges. The second is Yellow, which likes to be spontaneous, enthusiastic and charming. The Green personality type enjoys calm, stability and dependability. And the Blue type appreciates accuracy, order and caution. Knowing the desires and stressors of each of these types can help you adapt your message appropriately to ensure it will be well-received. This knowledge can also make your work environment more harmonious and effective

**The Economic Singularity, by Calum Chace**

The key message in these blinks:

We have the wealth and the ability to improve our world radically. Moving toward a universal basic income, a far shorter workweek, better indicators of societal progress and opening borders would have a transformative, positive impact on our lives. We just lack the imagination to believe in this achievable utopia.

**The Creativity Code by Marcus du sautoy**

The key message in these blinks:

Thanks to machine learning, the talents of modern AI exceed many of our previous expectations. Although they’re still struggling to recognize images and understand language, computers already create fascinating pieces of art, music and literature. However, until they learn to do so consciously and with purpose, they remain creative tools rather than being creative agents themselves

**Happy by Derren Brown**

The key message in these blinks:

Happiness isn’t about buying a new car or owning a villa in Tuscany – it’s about embracing what you already have and understanding what you can and can’t change. Once you’ve made that distinction, you can let go of the things which aren’t in your hands and focus your attention on what is: your feelings, thoughts and actions. And that’s good for your state of mind, relationships and blood pressure.

**Joy of work by Bruce daisley**

The key message in these blinks:

We need to develop a different work culture. One in which we have time and space in the mornings for working without distraction, for going on inspirational walks and having casual but productive conversations with coworkers. We need to put more emphasis on the social aspects of work by encouraging employees to take social breaks with their colleagues, where they feel free to open up and bond with one another. By working undistracted and being more social in the necessary breaks we take from work, we’ll be both happier and more productive.

Actionable advice: Get plenty of sleep.

**Notes on a nervous planet by Matt Haig**

The key message in these blinks:

Our contemporary lifestyle, and new technologies, in particular, contribute to stress, anxiety and depression. In order to stay happy and healthy, we need to cut out some of the overload of modern life. Once we become aware of the time we spend scrolling, working and worrying, we can learn to shift our focus and cultivate calmness to help through troubled times

**Talk: The science of conversation by Elizabeth Stokoe**

The key message in these blinks:

We converse spontaneously, but that doesn’t mean our conversations are random. Actually, most conversations are made up of key building blocks and follow predictable patterns. Understanding conversational elements and how they fit together is the best method for analyzing and improving how we talk, and for avoiding conversational pitfalls that create friction and misunderstandings.

Actionable advice: Use your words!

**Life's amazing secrets by gaur gopal das**

The key message in these blinks:

There are four crucial areas in human life: our personal lives, work lives, relationships and social contributions. Those areas are like the wheels on a car; they must be balanced and attended to if you want a smooth life journey. Spirituality is like the steering wheel, and you can develop your own spiritual practice by meditating. Once you’ve balanced your tires and taken hold of the wheel, you’ll be well on your way to a joyful and rewarding life.

Actionable advice: Right action, right intention, right mood.

**Do Breath by Michael Townsend Williams**

The key message in these blinks:

Life can often feel overwhelming and complicated. But the strategies you need to manage life’s stressors don’t have to be either of those things. When you’re feeling under pressure, going back to basics will help you find focus, clarity, and fulfilment. Bringing your awareness to something as simple as breathing is enough to create lasting and positive change.

Actionable advice: Strike a (power) pose!

The way you position yourself physically affects how others see you, as well as your own mood. Adjusting your stance can instantly boost confidence. The next time you need a quick self-esteem fix, try standing with your feet a little wider than your hips. Put your hands on your hips and take a few deep breaths into your belly. You’ll soon feel ready to take on the world!

**The Ruthless elimination of hurry by John Mark Comer**

The key message in these blinks:

We have all fallen prey to the **hurry disease**. We run from appointment to appointment, work long hours, sleep too little, and feel chronically stressed and exhausted. As a consequence, our relationships suffer, and we stop being able to be present in our own lives. Instead of looking to the latest meditation app for a solution, we can turn to the spiritual teachings of the Bible. Jesus was a master of mindfulness, long before that became a buzzword. He knew to take time for Himself, prioritize meaningful connections and limit what He consumed. By learning from His daily habits we can discover how to live more peaceful and fulfilling lives.

Actionable advice: “Parent” your phone by putting it to bed early in the evening.

Scrolling through your Facebook feed or replying to messages just before you go to sleep fills your mind with busy thoughts and stressful news. Treat your phone like you do your kids, and “put it to sleep” early in the evening, putting it on airplane mode or locking it in a drawer. You’ll have more time to relax and connect with your family or housemates and you’ll be able to fall asleep more easily because your mind is calmer.

**The Power of unwavering focus by Dandapani**

Your mind is vast and has many areas in it, but your awareness is finite. Awareness can be controlled by focus in constructive, rather than destructive, ways. Start slowly by bringing full attention and effort to small daily rituals. Expand this over time to give you control over where you direct and invest your mental energy. As your focus strengthens, the practice can help root out worry, overcome chronic stress, deepen your relationships, and change how you experience life.

Here’s a piece of actionable advice as you navigate your process:Keep going!

No matter how long it takes, once you’ve learned to focus completely during all five daily routines you’ve chosen – don’t stop! Make another list and choose five more daily rituals to take on. Add them one at a time and slowly, just like the first. Be sure to track your progress and reflect regularly, too. You’ll begin to notice how the more you stay focused each day, the more easily you prioritize and free up mental energy to invest in the things that truly matter in your life.

**Attention Span by Gloria Mark:**

Digital technologies have changed the structure of our attention. As our reliance on screens has solidified, our attention spans have shortened – the average worker now spends just 47 seconds on a screen before shifting attention. Our habit of self-interruption and multitasking is impacting our performance and, most importantly, our well-being.

It’s not all our fault: the internet is perfectly designed to engage our minds, and online companies have become experts at manipulating our attention. If we want to reclaim our digital agency and take control of our attention, we first need to understand these forces acting on it. Only then can we begin to flow with the natural rhythms of our attention while protecting it from distractions. We don’t need to get off the grid, or even uninstall Candy Crush – we just need to be smarter than our smart devices.

**Embrace the Suck by Brent Gleeson**

Instead of avoiding pain, embrace it and use it to propel you forward. By aligning your actions with your core values, you can face problems while remaining focused on your goals. Setting realistic targets and making steady progress requires self-discipline and self-awareness. So take small, incremental steps outside of your comfort zone to promote growth.Then, using the "See it, Own it, and Use it" model, you can use stress and fear to your advantage. So, embrace the suck and don't let failure cloud your vision of success – you are capable of overcoming any obstacle.

**The Power of Discipline by Daniel Walter**

If you’ve noticed that fear, low self-esteem, and poor habits are holding you back from accomplishing your goals, it’s most likely that you lack self-discipline. Self-discipline is a critical skill that can be acquired by targeting your prefrontal cortex through continuous practice. It can help you learn to prioritize tasks, filter distractions, and build better habits by getting in touch with your inner thoughts through deep focus and meditation.

**The Happiness Trap by Russ Harris**

Unpleasant thoughts and feelings will come up in your pursuit of a rich and meaningful life – but with the help of the six core principles of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, you can change the way you handle these thoughts and feelings. 
Just reading about the six core principles isn’t enough, however. You need to apply them to your daily life as well. Take action. A life of purpose and satisfaction awaits.

**Two weeks by Amy Porterfield**

Building an online business – and becoming your own boss – has never been so easy. You just need to draw on your unique skills and knowledge to come up with a good starter idea. This could mean offering coaching on a particular topic, selling a digital course, or providing a service that people can book online. Once you’ve got your basic strategy in place, you can plan your exit from your 9-to-5. 
A few simple steps will set your business up for success. For one, you need to have a good idea of your ideal customer. Then, you should aim to regularly put out content that caters to this target audience. And finally, you need to create a revenue-generating product that appeals to your loyal customer base. It could be anything from seminars on raising children to custom workout plans to coaching sessions on emotional eating – the possibilities are endless. And with the right approach, your business will bring you the creative, financial, and lifestyle freedom you deserve.App book read

When you’re feeling under pressure, going back to basics will help you find focus, clarity, and fulfilment. Bringing your awareness to something as simple as breathing is enough to create lasting and positive change.

Actionable advice: Strike a (power) pose!

The way you position yourself physically affects how others see you, as well as your own mood. Adjusting your stance can instantly boost confidence. The next time you need a quick self-esteem fix, try standing with your feet a little wider than your hips. Put your hands on your hips and take a few deep breaths into your belly. You’ll soon feel ready to take on the world!

**The Ruthless elimination of hurry by John Mark Comer**

The key message in these blinks:

We have all fallen prey to the **hurry disease**. We run from appointment to appointment, work long hours, sleep too little, and feel chronically stressed and exhausted. As a consequence, our relationships suffer, and we stop being able to be present in our own lives. Instead of looking to the latest meditation app for a solution, we can turn to the spiritual teachings of the Bible. Jesus was a master of mindfulness, long before that became a buzzword. He knew to take time for Himself, prioritize meaningful connections and limit what He consumed. By learning from His daily habits we can discover how to live more peaceful and fulfilling lives.

Actionable advice: “Parent” your phone by putting it to bed early in the evening.

Scrolling through your Facebook feed or replying to messages just before you go to sleep fills your mind with busy thoughts and stressful news. Treat your phone like you do your kids, and “put it to sleep” early in the evening, putting it on airplane mode or locking it in a drawer. You’ll have more time to relax and connect with your family or housemates and you’ll be able to fall asleep more easily because your mind is calmer.

**The Power of unwavering focus by Dandapani**

Your mind is vast and has many areas in it, but your awareness is finite. Awareness can be controlled by focus in constructive, rather than destructive, ways. Start slowly by bringing full attention and effort to small daily rituals. Expand this over time to give you control over where you direct and invest your mental energy. As your focus strengthens, the practice can help root out worry, overcome chronic stress, deepen your relationships, and change how you experience life.

Here’s a piece of actionable advice as you navigate your process:Keep going!

No matter how long it takes, once you’ve learned to focus completely during all five daily routines you’ve chosen – don’t stop! Make another list and choose five more daily rituals to take on. Add them one at a time and slowly, just like the first. Be sure to track your progress and reflect regularly, too. You’ll begin to notice how the more you stay focused each day, the more easily you prioritize and free up mental energy to invest in the things that truly matter in your life.

**Attention Span by Gloria Mark:**

Digital technologies have changed the structure of our attention. As our reliance on screens has solidified, our attention spans have shortened – the average worker now spends just 47 seconds on a screen before shifting attention. Our habit of self-interruption and multitasking is impacting our performance and, most importantly, our well-being.

It’s not all our fault: the internet is perfectly designed to engage our minds, and online companies have become experts at manipulating our attention. If we want to reclaim our digital agency and take control of our attention, we first need to understand these forces acting on it. Only then can we begin to flow with the natural rhythms of our attention while protecting it from distractions. We don’t need to get off the grid, or even uninstall Candy Crush – we just need to be smarter than our smart devices.

**Embrace the Suck by Brent Gleeson**

Instead of avoiding pain, embrace it and use it to propel you forward. By aligning your actions with your core values, you can face problems while remaining focused on your goals. Setting realistic targets and making steady progress requires self-discipline and self-awareness. So take small, incremental steps outside of your comfort zone to promote growth.Then, using the "See it, Own it, and Use it" model, you can use stress and fear to your advantage. So, embrace the suck and don't let failure cloud your vision of success – you are capable of overcoming any obstacle.

**The Power of Discipline by Daniel Walter**

If you’ve noticed that fear, low self-esteem, and poor habits are holding you back from accomplishing your goals, it’s most likely that you lack self-discipline. Self-discipline is a critical skill that can be acquired by targeting your prefrontal cortex through continuous practice. It can help you learn to prioritize tasks, filter distractions, and build better habits by getting in touch with your inner thoughts through deep focus and meditation.

**The Happiness Trap by Russ Harris**

Unpleasant thoughts and feelings will come up in your pursuit of a rich and meaningful life – but with the help of the six core principles of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, you can change the way you handle these thoughts and feelings. 
Just reading about the six core principles isn’t enough, however. You need to apply them to your daily life as well. Take action. A life of purpose and satisfaction awaits.

**Two weeks by Amy Porterfield**

Building an online business – and becoming your own boss – has never been so easy. You just need to draw on your unique skills and knowledge to come up with a good starter idea.

Once you’ve got your basic strategy in place, you can plan your exit from your 9-to-5. 
A few simple steps will set your business up for success. For one, you need to have a good idea of your ideal customer. Then, you should aim to regularly put out content that caters to this target audience. And finally, you need to create a revenue-generating product that appeals to your loyal customer base. It could be anything from seminars on raising children to custom workout plans to coaching sessions on emotional eating – the possibilities are endless. And with the right approach, your business will bring you the creative, financial, and lifestyle freedom you deserve.App book read

**Surrounded by idiots by Thomas erikson**

The key message in these blinks:

If you want to avoid misunderstandings and make your efforts at communication more effective, then it is in your best interest to understand the four basic personality types. The first personality type is Red, which responds well to being in charge and dealing with challenges. The second is Yellow, which likes to be spontaneous, enthusiastic and charming. The Green personality type enjoys calm, stability and dependability. And the Blue type appreciates accuracy, order and caution. Knowing the desires and stressors of each of these types can help you adapt your message appropriately to ensure it will be well-received. This knowledge can also make your work environment more harmonious and effective

**The Economic Singularity, by Calum Chace**

The key message in these blinks:

We have the wealth and the ability to improve our world radically. Moving toward a universal basic income, a far shorter workweek, better indicators of societal progress and opening borders would have a transformative, positive impact on our lives. We just lack the imagination to believe in this achievable utopia.

**The Creativity Code by Marcus du sautoy**

The key message in these blinks:

Thanks to machine learning, the talents of modern AI exceed many of our previous expectations. Although they’re still struggling to recognize images and understand language, computers already create fascinating pieces of art, music and literature. However, until they learn to do so consciously and with purpose, they remain creative tools rather than being creative agents themselves

**Happy by Derren Brown**

The key message in these blinks:

Happiness isn’t about buying a new car or owning a villa in Tuscany – it’s about embracing what you already have and understanding what you can and can’t change. Once you’ve made that distinction, you can let go of the things which aren’t in your hands and focus your attention on what is: your feelings, thoughts and actions. And that’s good for your state of mind, relationships and blood pressure.

**Joy of work by Bruce daisley**

The key message in these blinks:

We need to develop a different work culture. One in which we have time and space in the mornings for working without distraction, for going on inspirational walks and having casual but productive conversations with coworkers. We need to put more emphasis on the social aspects of work by encouraging employees to take social breaks with their colleagues, where they feel free to open up and bond with one another. By working undistracted and being more social in the necessary breaks we take from work, we’ll be both happier and more productive.

Actionable advice: Get plenty of sleep.

**Notes on a nervous planet by Matt Haig**

The key message in these blinks:

Our contemporary lifestyle, and new technologies, in particular, contribute to stress, anxiety and depression. In order to stay happy and healthy, we need to cut out some of the overload of modern life. Once we become aware of the time we spend scrolling, working and worrying, we can learn to shift our focus and cultivate calmness to help through troubled times

**Talk: The science of conversation by Elizabeth Stokoe**

The key message in these blinks:

We converse spontaneously, but that doesn’t mean our conversations are random. Actually, most conversations are made up of key building blocks and follow predictable patterns. Understanding conversational elements and how they fit together is the best method for analyzing and improving how we talk, and for avoiding conversational pitfalls that create friction and misunderstandings.

Actionable advice: Use your words!

**Life's amazing secrets by gaur gopal das**

The key message in these blinks:

There are four crucial areas in human life: our personal lives, work lives, relationships and social contributions. Those areas are like the wheels on a car; they must be balanced and attended to if you want a smooth life journey. Spirituality is like the steering wheel, and you can develop your own spiritual practice by meditating. Once you’ve balanced your tires and taken hold of the wheel, you’ll be well on your way to a joyful and rewarding life.

Actionable advice: Right action, right intention, right mood.
